But the geometric error remains nearly flat â€” 
meaning that averaging over more frames reduces intra-subject variance
 but does not necessarily bring the average mesh closer to ground truth.

The averaging helps eliminate stochastic noise, but:
If all frames are consistently biased (e.g., same nose deformation), 
the average still carries that bias.
Therefore, while WBES improves (better separation), 
the error toward GT doesn't necessarily go down.
This behavior holds both for meshes and for landmarks.
